# üìå Research Paper Overview & Execution Guide

## **üîç Overview**
This project explores **cryptocurrency volatility prediction and portfolio optimization** using advanced machine learning and econometric models. The methodology integrates **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks**, **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**, and **CVI (Crypto Volatility Index)** for improved financial risk assessment and investment decision-making.

The objective is to optimize portfolio allocation by leveraging **Sharpe Ratio Maximization** and **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)** techniques, ensuring **risk-adjusted returns** are optimized.

## **üìñ Paper Contributions**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Volatility Prediction using LSTM-GARCH-CVI**
- **GARCH models** are used to estimate the time-varying volatility of cryptocurrencies.
- **LSTM models** leverage deep learning to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in financial time series data.
- **Crypto Volatility Index (CVI)** is included to enhance predictive power by incorporating overall market sentiment and risk perception.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Portfolio Optimization**
- **Classic Sharpe Ratio Optimization:**
  - Maximizes the Sharpe Ratio:
    \[
    Sharpe = \frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{\sigma_p}
    \]
  - Where \(E[R_p]\) is expected return, \(R_f\) is the risk-free rate, and \(\sigma_p\) is portfolio volatility.
- **CVaR-Based Optimization:**
  - Focuses on **tail risk management**, ensuring protection against extreme losses.
  - Uses:
    \[
    CVaR_{\alpha} = E[R | R < VaR_{\alpha}]
    \]
  - Which represents expected loss given that the portfolio is in the worst \(\alpha\)% of cases.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Implementation via API**
- The entire methodology is encapsulated within a **FastAPI-based microservice**, allowing users to:
  - **Train and deploy LSTM-GARCH models**
  - **Fetch real-time market data**
  - **Optimize portfolios dynamically**
  - **Visualize volatility predictions and allocation strategies**
